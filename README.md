This is my personal and public notes.Firstly, I would like to say thank you to [Azer Koçulu](https://github.com/azer) because I inspired from him and decided to create a repo for my personal and public notes.
I'm hoping to use here because as Azer said "for remembering things and also letting my mind with yours."
